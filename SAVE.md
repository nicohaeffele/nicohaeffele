CHAPTER 1 - A new beginning 
-------------

I always hated the ferric taste of blood in my mouth. It's even worse when it's a blend of blood, saliva and dirt.
It seem's stupid to attach an importance to this detail when your are slowly losing consciousness, but trust me, when you have a dagger proudly stuck in your back, it helps. This hopeless feeling, the pain, I don't event remember the last time I felt something like that. My mind was clouded, my eyes were foggy. Thinking was becoming harder with every drop of blood splashing on the puddle that was now under me. 
While hearing cries and footsteps far away from my private pool, I asked myself what the fuck happened for me to end in this state. This question accompanied me while my consciousness faded away. Sleep, yeah, sleep is always the best.

In the middle of a quiet and dimly lit palace far away from the worries of common men sat a priestess. 
She was held in hight esteem by the plebeian. Venerated for her grace, beauty and good deeds aiming at improving the lives of billions of her people. Watch duty of the guards protecting her was a highly sought-after position. The calm of her meditation was only broken by her rhythmic and melodious breathing. 

When she suddenly opened her eyes a flash of light blinded the spectators. A groan escaped from her mouth while she was pulled into the air by a mystic force. A vision occurred.  

It was a sight to behold, seeing her when a vision occurs. A small flash of light followed by a few mystic sentences. But it never happened to be something so majestic, overbearing and dangerous. Records of her bloodline never mentioned an effect this disproportionated. A sun was illuminating the pillar of the room, all people present could hear her groan transform into cry for help and see her bloody tears run along her pale cheeks.  

Something went wrong, the guards knew it. The captain knew it too ! Unable to cope with the situation he sent one of his men to seek her father, the King. Everything happened so quickly that nobody could even react when the light disappeared and she fell to the ground like an inarticulate doll.    

"Priestess, princess, miss, Merry, please, respond, can you hear me ?"

Matthiew the captain of her guard was aghast when he saw her in this state. He tried to bring her back to herself but the only answer he got was a feverish whisper : 

"Find him, the one who walks among us but is not one of us. The golden immortal, find him and help him. If he dies or loose it again, we are doomed. Doom...ed..."

"Merry, Merry, please, stay with me ! What do you mean by golden immortal ? What do you mean by loose it ? Please stay with me.
GUARDS, SEND MEDICAL SUPPORT NOW ! Merry, come back, Merry ... "

Those cry faded away, where her consciousness was heading to, it was impossible to hear them.

CHAPTER X - Fate meeting 
-------------

In the other side of the plane, in the middle of the wilderness, life was different. The law of the strongest reigns supreme. Brutality, slaughter and feasting on the weak was common for the beasts dwelling in this non-hospitable land. 
In the farthest end of this region sat a lonely peak. No man ever placed his foot on this place since immemorial time. 
And it would be unadvised to try, unless you were trying to throw away your life of course. 

The king among beast "Rhargh" was sleeping peacefully on his throne. His weapon, discarded somewhere in the room, it was not like he needed it. He was the kind of king that didn't even expect an attack in his sleep. Few being were able to threaten him and he would be able to smell them from miles away.

No, what woke him up was a chill, a chill that made his very own soul shake. His slit pupil lost focus. One moment he was in his warm seat and a split second later he was diving in cold water. He lived his whole life basking under that sun, he knew. The pressure disappeared, something happened ! He roared : 

"Realder, Rurisk"     

His kin appeared in front of him and bowed in a practiced manner while he was getting up from his seat and warming up his sore shoulder from the uncomfortable sleep position.

"Father"
"Father" 

"Stand up my sons. Did you feel it ?" Asked Rhargh while scanning the two pride of his life. 

"He is dead !" Responded Rurisk hurriedly.

"Not necessarily..." Outbade his brother. "The pressure has not totally disappeared, it's just weaker. So faint we almost can't feel it anymore."

"Well done Realder, it's true, do the two of you know what it means ?"

"It's an opportunity." Responded Rurisk while clenching his claw.

"It's a disaster..." Whispered Realder.

"Once more, Realder is right."

Rurisk was already blazing with fury, his brother already shot him down twice and the worse part was that his father agreed with him. 

The competition between the brothers was not unknown to Rhargh but he hoped they would put it aside one day for the greater good. For now it was an unreachable goal it seems. How pointless...  

"Why ?! Why do you always take his side ? If he is not on his throne, it's our chance to shine. If he lost his divinity it's our turn to take it. If he disappeared it's a lucky chance for us. We can ransack his whole lair. The two of you knows for how long he has taken all the nice shiny things for himself. Letting us the cheap and broken leftovers he did not care about."

"Silence son ! The lesson I taught you has not been learned it seems. Our own blood paid the price for a mutiny, your grand-father and great-grand-father paid a steep price for their insolence. My father doomed his family for selfish reasons and I won't let it happen again." 

"What about our honor ? Would you rather live like a slave for the rest of your pitiful life ?" Rurisk retorted

"What do you know about slave life son ? Have you ever worked during your long life ? What have you accomplished ? Your longevity doesn't excuse your arrogance." A low growl escaped his maw. "During their short life humans are sometimes able to accomplish things you can't even fathom. They work together and leave their whole life of work to prosperity. That's what help them move forward, step by step."

"Humans are insects !!!" Scornfully remarked Rurisk. 

"Oh ?! Really ? then what are you in front of the immortal ?" Asked Rhargh amused.

"He... It's not the same, he is an exception, he is an anomaly !"

"An anomaly ?!" Roared his father "A puny human who overcame the limit of his race. Who followed the martial path to the peak and still carried on climbing on this lonely road, without anyone before him to pave his path on top of that? You are god damn right my son, he is an anomaly, the sole exception that only a few people alive can brag to have met." 

Trying to regain his cool, Rhargh took a long and deep breath.  

"This monster, because that's what he is, a pure monster. He gave us a helping hand when we were at our lowest, without expecting anything in return. And how did we thank him ? The way we are, beast style, we tried to rebel like the ungrateful bunch of mutt we were. It was pure folly to confront a man who protected his plan alone since immemorial times. So tell me boy, tell me, will you fight him yourself ? You, small Rurisk ?" asked mockingly the old being. 

"It's unjust ! Nobody know if those stories are true, you know it well ! Today it's only a broken soul who can't even pressure us anymore. He's nothing, we can win." Retorted the most rebellious son. 

"If it's truly what you think my son you are as stupid as my father was and I failed your education. When the next moon comes up, what will we do without him ? We'll be slaughtered." Sneered Rhargh.

"We can be lucky !" Tried Rurisk 

"No warrior put his life at risk with luck as his only wild card. Only fools..." Countered his father. 

The verbal joust was becoming weaker and weaker but deep inside himself Rhargh knew that his son was already lost to greed. Every reason he could find would be a good reason. As a father and also as one of the last remnant of his race he couldn't agree with his son. But could he stop him ? Now yes, but not eternally. He needed to learn the hard way. The sole way to really understand that they were not the apex predators on the food chain.

"I will prove you wrong, I will not spend my life as the bitch of someone else. I will live my life with honor !" Said Rurisk in an last statement.

"Then you will not live long my son. Ask your dead grand-father if honor matters. Silence will be your only answer."

It was hard to say, but it was harsher to hear. Shocked, the two sons looked at their father.
Furious, Rurisk took flight and fled. He knew his coward of a father would never agree with him, talking was useless. He didn't reflect on the next course of action but he didn't care, the most important thing was to advance ! Proud of himself he disappeared in the clouds. 

Inside the lair, Rhargh has sighting to himself before looking at his second son.

"Realder"

"Yes, father ?" inquired the serious son.

"Find him, no matter the situation, no matter the scale of damage that happened, find him and help him. When the next blood moon appears we will need him in his peak state. If we fail in this duty we are screwed !" Sighted the old king. 

He seemed to have aged a lot during this sole conversation. It was only exacerbating the urgency of the situation. 
He slipped his hand under his doublet and pulled an old string. A shiny golden ring was dangling on the narrow rope. He snapped it and dropped it in the open hand of his son. 

"This ring is his mark, he gave it to me when I sweared loyalty to him. Even if my words from back then don't mean anything for him, they are heavy in my heart. Follow your intuition, follow the pressure, follow your heart. You are fighting for the well being of everyone."    

The weight of the ring felt off compared to the size. It seems to be as heavy as a mountain for Realder. Responsibility often gave this feeling. His knuckles cracked while clenching his paw. He looked at his father and asked :

"What are you gonna do about Rurisk, father ?" inquired Realder. 

"The two of you are already a million year old, you are "
